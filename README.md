# Today I Learned

Well, after I occasionally take a look at [thoughtbot's github](https://github.com/thoughtbot/til), I'm motived. So I decide to create the same repo for myself, here we are.

We are constantly learning new things. This is a repo to share my learnings. TILs are short Markdown documents (a few sentences + example code) explaining a new concept, bit of syntax, command, or tip that I've learned.
